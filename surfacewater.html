                            Recent studies have shown that the timing and availability of spring runoff is changing, which probably will substantially affect the way surface water has to be managed in URGB.
                            Because of the crucial role of the Rio Grande and its tributaries, it is important that water managers be able to plan for changes in the timing and availability of surface water and integrate knowledge of likely surface-water changes into a water-budget assessment.

                    <h3 id="timing">Timing and Trends</h3>
                    <p>
                        Trends in the departure from long-term average streamflow parameters (maximum, minimum, and median) can change abruptly and are not always predictable.
                        Because changes in streamflow could substantially affect the way surface water must be managed in the URGB, it is important that water managers have a readily available and up-to-date assessment of surface-water resources.
                        The approach to complete this study component is:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Obtain daily mean streamflow data from the network of USGS streamflow gaging stations within the URGB.</li>
                        <li>Update, expand, and refine the assessment of annual streamflow in New Mexico conducted by Affinati and Myers.</li>
                        <li> Evaluate streamflow trends, timing, and estimated streamflow and storage on the subbasin scale, considering the effects of reservoir releases and gains and losses of conveyance structures.</li>
                        <li>Analyze historical streamflow records from selected sites on the Rio Grande and selected tributaries for trends in seasonal and annual streamflow including start of spring runoff and peak flow.</li>
                        <li>Incorporate surface-water timing and trends information with the timing and trends of surface-water/groundwater exchange component (detailed in the Surface-Water and Groundwater Exchange section).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3 id="modeling">Watershed Modeling</h3>
                    <p>
                        Watershed modeling will be conducted using the National Hydrologic Model, specifically the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS), developed by the Modeling of Watershed Systems USGS working group.
                        The approach to complete this study component is:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Assign model connections (such as seg_type and hru_type) and parameters based on local knowledge and utilization of other existing modeling efforts in the basin (such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Upper Rio Grande Water Operation Model).</li>
                        <li>Calibrate Region 13 (Rio Grande) of the USGS National Hydrologic Model constructed using PRMS.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3 id="snow">Snow Processes</h3>
                    <p>
                        The primary goal of this task is to quantify and assess the snow water resources portion of the surface-water component of the URGB water budget for a selected subbasin, specifically to (1) add additional instrumentation to existing SNOTEL sites to enhance current snowpack data-collection efforts, (2) calibrate a snowpack evolution model using both new and existing instrumentation to develop gridded estimates of SWE, snow sublimation, and snowmelt runoff in one study subbasin, and (3) compare SnowModel results to current snow depletion curves used by forecasting agencies and PRMS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Rio Grande Headwaters study subbasin was chosen as the study area due to the deep snowpacks that are accumulated in this area, and relative spatial density of existing SNOTEL sites.
                        Additionally, working in this subbasin allows for a collaborative effort with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), which is currently conducting snowmelt research in the adjacent Conejos subbasin.
                        The spatial and temporal overlap of USGS and NCAR measurements and models will provide valuable information about snowmelt modeling approaches in the area as well as likely lead to additional collaborative work in the URGB headwaters.
                        The approach to complete this study component is:

                    <h5>SNOTEL Equipment Installation</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Purchase and install SNOTEL enhancement equipment.
                            Two SNOTEL sites (Beartown and Middle Creek) will gain additional equipment.
                            One site (Snow Mesa) will be built with reduced equipment to provide greater spatial variability of data collection.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5>Data Collection</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Collect data from installed equipment during the study period.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5>Modeling</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Use collected data as input for SnowModel for the Upper Rio Grande Headwaters subbasin in the defined model domain.</li>
                        <li>Model snowpack evolution, including wind redistribution and sublimation loss for both data collection years.</li>
                        <li>Compare SnowModel results with current snow depletion curves used by PRMS for watershed modeling in the URGB.</li>
