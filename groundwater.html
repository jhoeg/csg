                            The Rio Grande Basin is composed of a sequence of alluvial sub-basins that formed in the Rio Grande rift 
                            approximately 30 million years ago. The Rio Grande rift is a north-south trending structural feature that 
                            developed during a period of tectonic extension where the Earth’s crust was pulled apart and a series of 
                            normal faults created alternating mountain ranges and basins.

                        Basin-fill deposits, known as the Santa Fe Group, were derived from the adjacent mountain ranges, dune
                        deposits from windblown sand, and volcanic deposits from local volcanic areas. The Santa Fe Group aquifer
                        system is the primary aquifer in the URGB and is divided into three parts: the upper, middle, and lower.
                        Much of the lower part may have low permeability and poor water chemistry; thus, groundwater is mostly
                        withdrawn from the upper and middle parts of the aquifer. Only about the upper 2,000 feet of the aquifer
                        is typically used for groundwater withdrawal.

                        Water enters the Santa Fe Group aquifer system from mountain front recharge, seepage from the Rio Grande and
                        its tributaries, transmission losses from conveyance structures, and excess irrigation. Groundwater discharges
                        from the Santa Fe Group aquifer system from pumpage from wells, seepage into the Rio Grande and riverside
                        drains, springs, evapotranspiration, and subsurface outflow. If groundwater pumpage from an aquifer exceeds
                        recharge, water levels in the aquifer decline, as has been observed throughout the URGB. These declining water
                        levels can have adverse effects on long-term groundwater availability and sustainability, water quality, and
                        land subsidence. The approach to complete this study component is:

                            Compile the digital boundaries of all subbasins in the URGB into a geodatabase. Some of the subbasins have 
                            well defined digital boundaries, but many do not. Subbasin boundaries will be acquired as digital data files 
                            from previous studies and (or) will be digitized in a vector format from figures in the literature.
