                            Surface-water and groundwater exchange along tributaries and the main stem of the Rio Grande may sustain flow in some reaches, while decreasing flow in others.
                            Differences in monthly mean streamflow at selected gages will be analyzed for general bulk gains and losses in streamflow and stream reaches between selected gages will be categorized on a seasonal basis as strongly gaining, gaining, no gain/loss, losing, or strongly losing.
                            Surface-water/groundwater exchange will be evaluated using stream stage and water-level measurements where data exist.
                            Seepage from the Rio Grande and riverside drains will be compiled and integrated to characterize losses from the river to the groundwater system in various reaches.

                            In order to determine relative contributions of groundwater and surface water at specific sites within the URGB, two types of hydrograph separation techniques will be explored: automatic/mathematical and hydrochemical (specific conductance).
                            Prior to employing the hydrochemical technique, an inventory of streamflow records within NWIS will be conducted to determine streamgage locations where both discharge and specific conductivity data have been collected over the same time period in the URGB.
                            Streamgages determined to have sufficient data density to assess variability will be chosen for further hydrograph separation techniques using the USGS Groundwater Toolbox.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Automated streamflow-hydrograph methods, such as HYSEP or PART will be applied to estimate the baseflow component of streamflow.
                            Both methods estimate the contribution from groundwater to streamflow by using daily streamflow response to an event; PART uses the rate and shape of streamflow recession curves while HYSEP uses an algorithm to create a linear interpolation between low points on the hydrograph, thus separating event flow from baseflow.
                            Results will be analyzed to evaluate trends and quantify the amount and spatial distribution of groundwater contribution to streamflow in the Rio Grande.
                            Automated hydrograph separation techniques have limitations; they assume no loss of groundwater to the underlying aquifer (“losing behavior”), and are not recommended for drainage areas less than one square mile or greater than 500 square miles.
                            Additionally, automated hydrograph separation may not be appropriate for reaches directly downstream of reservoirs, as the methods can not differentiate between a storm event and a reservoir release.
                            Inventory of existing data and preliminary analysis will be necessary to determine where these methods can be applied in the URGB.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The contribution of groundwater to streams and rivers can also be quantified using hydrochemical data and a mass-balance approach.
                            Groundwater contribution to surface water within select/specific areas of the URGB has been quantified previously using a variety of hydrochemical separation techniques.
                            The methods used in these studies are generally limited by the frequency, locations, and breadth of hydrochemical data collection.
                            The development and use of a technique using specific conductance (SC) to quantify groundwater contribution to surface water in the URGB would expand the temporal and spatial resolution understanding of these groundwater/surface water connections.
                            Investigations in the Colorado River Basin have developed a two-component separation technique using SC to separate baseflow and streamflow for selected snowmelt-dominated subbasins.
                            The feasibility of this technique to subbasins in the URGB and application to those areas will be explored as the effect of reservoir storage and release on SC in the URGB will not be consistent with snowmelt-dominated flow.

                            Response functions characterize the unique functional relation between pumping at a particular location in an aquifer and the resulting depletion in a nearby stream.
                            Response-function maps are particularly useful for illustrating the effects of pumping location on streamflow depletion within a large set of possible pumping locations within an aquifer.
                            Appropriate existing numerical groundwater models will be used to generate response functions and capture maps.
                            The primary goal of this study component is to quantify and assess the spatial and temporal variability of surface-water/groundwater exchange in the URGB using available data.
                            The approach to complete this study component is:
